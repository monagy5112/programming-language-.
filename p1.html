	Programming languages are used to power the technology we use every day.
	IEEE Spectrum has come out with their fourth interactive ranking of the top programming languages, with Python ranking first,  and C++ trailing at fourth-place.

Python: Behind your favorite website, Python is at work. Coders use this web-based basic scripting language to program the backend of websites like YouTube,
Instagram, Pinterest and Quora.This may surprise you; I have kept python on number #2, in many of the surveys it is positioned on number #5. But, I will definitely let you believe, here’s why?

Python is one of the general purpose, user-friendly programming language here on my list. What makes it so? Like Java, Python syntax is clear, intuitive and almost similar to the English language. Python’s “object-based” subset is somewhere similar to JavaScript.

According to Stack Overflow, there is one section which says “To be adopted or migrated to be—or to migrate too soon”, and for python, it’s 12% which is highest. Broadly, people who have migrated to python are close to 42%, which signifies it to be at number #2.

If you are interested in making your career in back-end development, like Django – Open source framework, is written in python, which makes it easy to learn and feature-packed, yet popular. Also, python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile and powerful.

Being so popular in areas like scientific computing, and machine learning and engineering, Python supports a programming style that uses simple functions and variables without much interrogating in class definitions.
C: This language is one of the first high-level languages developed and is fast, structured, portable and has a rich library.The C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at the AT&T Corporation for programming computer operating systems. Its capacity to structure data and programs through the composition of smaller units is comparable to that of ALGOL. It uses a compact notation and provides the programmer with the ability to operate with the addresses of data as well as with their values. This ability is important in systems programming, and C shares with assembly language the power to exploit all the features of a computer’s internal architecture. C, along with its descendant C++, remains one of the most common languages. All of these features allow C to have applications across every domain in the world of programming.
C is used in all the operating systems in your computer and your cellphone and even in programming robots.
Java: Java places third on the list and for good reason — it can run on many devices. If you have an Android phone, all of your apps are running Java.
Big data technologies are using Java as their language of choice because of its excellent capabilities of compiling and organizing data.
C++: This programming language is an object-oriented programming language that incorporates all the features of C. C++ is used for operating systems, games, embedded software,
autonomous cars and medical technology, as well as many other applications. Companies like Facebook and Google use C++.
Coding and programming languages are a huge part of our everyday lives and are building the future of technology. Many makers have created projects for the IEEE Maker Project using these programming languages.
